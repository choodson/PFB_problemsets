Someone by Shel Silverstein

Someone loves me,
Someone cares,
Someone picks me peaches and pears.
Someone offers me candy and Cokes,
Someone listens and laughs at me jokes.
Someone helps when I get in a fight,
Someone does all my homework at night.
Someone misses me,
Someone cries,
Someone thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Someone is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Someone just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Someone's hand,
In the darkness where Someone usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Someone's gone!
